The API documentation we are using for this project is https://pullpush.io/
Using this API we can use query calls to search submissions and comments from reddit from archived reddit data

Group members:
One of the officers told us about web scrappers we could alternatively use as opposed to the pullpush.io 
These are Selenium and Beautiful Soup

We need to look into legal use of web scrapping and data from reddit cause if we get to spring showcase we should be 
doing everything legally :)
